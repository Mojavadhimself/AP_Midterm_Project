📘 Project Description
This project simulates a mini Unix-style file system with core functionalities including creation, deletion, navigation, and editing of directories and .txt files. It is implemented using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, emphasizing clean code, extensibility, and user interaction via terminal-like commands.

🛠️ Features
📁 Directory Operations
mkdir <path> <folder_name>: Create a directory.

rm <path>: Remove a directory.

cd <path>: Change to the given directory.

cd ..: Go up one level.

ls: List files and folders in the current directory.

📄 File Operations
touch <path> <file_name>.txt: Create a new text file.

rm <path>: Delete a file.

nwfiletxt <path>: Overwrite file content with new lines.

appendtxt <path>: Append new lines to the end of a file.

editline <path> <line> <text>: Edit a specific line in a file.

deline <path> <line>: Delete a specific line in a file.

cat <path>: Display file contents.

📦 File/Folder Management
mv <source_path> <destination_path>: Move a file or folder.

cp <source_path> <destination_path>: Copy a file or folder (deep copy).

rename <path> <new_name>: Rename file or folder.
